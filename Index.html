      Farmer Fred's Watermelon Paradise!
    </header>
    <p>Watermelon is thought to have originated in the Kalahari Desert of Africa. The first recorded watermelon harvest occurred nearly 5,000 years ago in Egypt and is depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphics on walls of their ancient buildings. Watermelons were often placed in the burial tombs of kings to nourish them in the afterlife. <br>
      <br>
      From there, watermelons spread throughout countries along the Mediterranean Sea by way of merchant ships. By the 10th century, watermelon found its way to China, which is now the world's number one producer of watermelons.<br>
      <br>
      The 13th century found watermelon spread through the rest of Europe via the Moors.</p>
